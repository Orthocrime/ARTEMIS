#Expected features and functionality from 0.6
	should have a button that saves the table in the detailed view to clipboard with table formatting intact;
	should make the sum of highlighted cells selectable for copying;
	should make each row higher and each column narrower for more compact look;
	should further test whether edit function in the program can actually create more than one numerical value within a cell or can is able only edit the values (the precise number of value units) present at the moment of excel file import;
		it is desirable for user to edit a cell in a way that allows to create as many or as little units of numerical values within the single cell as needed while retaining the summation function;
	should allow to create new rows;
	should make \ automatically break line;
	should have some form of backup creation for rollbacks
	suggestion:
		possibly the source file should be copied once the program is run, deleted if no edits made upon program termination
			the backup file should be retained for a number days and deleted when program is run after the set day count is up
				the user should be able to replace the source file with back up file if so chosen in a context menu (??)



moved to future 0700 build
#should be able to distinguish between general database view and a search bar view which only shows results for queried phrases or numbers
#should be able to discard any decimals that are either equal to 0 or would round down to less than .01; implemented in 0550
#should be able to retain past database iterations for rollbacks
#should have user account system for accountability logging
#should be able to retain formatting from source excel file

already implemented ahead of relase 0600:
	should be able to show what values are summed from data located in cells that have more than one numerical value in them upon data clean up; implemented in 0550
	general redundancy check-up; minor decluttering done in 0550
